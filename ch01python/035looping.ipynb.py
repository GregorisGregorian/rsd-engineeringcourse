# ## Iteration

# %% [markdown]
# Our other aspect of control is looping back on ourselves.
#
# We use `for` ... `in` ... to "iterate" over lists:

# %%
mylist = [3, 7, 15, 2]

for element in mylist:
    print(element ** 2)

# %% [markdown]
# Each time through the loop, the value in the `element` slot is updated to the **next** value in the sequence.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Iterables

# %% [markdown]
#
# Any sequence type is iterable:
#
#
#

# %%
vowels = "aeiou"

sarcasm = []

for letter in "Okay":
    if letter.lower() in vowels:
        repetition = 3
    else:
        repetition = 1
    sarcasm.append(letter * repetition)

"".join(sarcasm)

# %% [markdown]
# The above is a little puzzle, work through it to understand why it does what it does

# %% [markdown]
# ## Â Dictionaries are Iterables

# %% [markdown]
# All sequences are iterables. Some iterables (things you can `for` loop over) are not sequences (things with you can do `x[5]` to), for example **sets**.

# %%
import datetime

now = datetime.datetime.now()

founded = {"James": 1976, "UCL": 1826, "Cambridge": 1209}

current_year = now.year

for x in founded:
    print(x, "is", current_year - founded[x], "years old.")

# %%
thing = "UCL"

founded[thing]

# %%
founded

# %%
founded.items()

# %% [markdown]
# ## Unpacking and Iteration

# %% [markdown]
#
# Unpacking can be useful with iteration:
#
#
#

# %%
triples=[
    [4, 11, 15], 
    [39, 4, 18]
]

# %%
for whatever in triples:
    print(whatever)

# %%
a, b = [36, 7]

# %%
b

# %%
for first, middle, last in triples:
    print(middle)

# %%
# A reminder that the words you use for variable names are arbitrary:
for hedgehog, badger, fox in triples:
    print(badger)

# %% [markdown]
#
#
#
# For example, to iterate over the items in a dictionary as pairs:
#
#
#

# %%
for name, year in founded.items():
    print(name, "is", current_year - year, "years old.")

# %%
for name in founded:
    print(name, "is", current_year - founded[name], "years old.")

# %% [markdown]
# ## Break, Continue

# %% [markdown]
#
# * Continue skips to the next turn of a loop
# * Break stops the loop early
#
#
#

# %%
for n in range(50):
    if n == 20:
        break
    if n % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print(n)

# %% [markdown]
# These aren't useful that often, but are worth knowing about. There's also an optional `else` clause on loops, executed only if if the loop gets through all it's iterations without a `break`, but I've never found that useful.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Exercise: the Maze Population

# %% [markdown]
# Take your maze data structure. Write a program to count the total number of people in the maze, and also determine the total possible occupants.
